                <p>
                    The Junior Chamber movement came into existence in Canada in 1923 with the formation of its first
                    chapter, the Young Men’s Section of the Winnipeg Board of Trade. Just as it was when it was founded
                    in St. Louis, the Junior Chamber movement in Canada involved organizing young people to meet their
                    needs in terms of learning and development, and in turn meeting both the current and future needs of
                    their community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1936 representatives from chapters across Canada met in Toronto on February 2 and wrote a
                    constitution that officially founded the Canadian Junior Chamber of Commerce. History is rich with
                    examples of JCI Canada members who have been actively involved in the success of the International
                    Junior Chamber. One of the most outstanding members was certainly Phil Pugsley of Montreal, Canada
                    who became the seventh JCI President in 1951. Pugsley envisioned the idea of a Senatorship which
                    could honour and recognize the achievements of exceptional members and could enable them to remain
                    in contact with the Junior Chamber movement throughout their life. Through his perseverance, the JCI
                    Senate was created in 1952 at the 7th JCI World Congress in Melbourne, Australia.

                    On the organizational level, JCI Canada hosted and organized many events throughout the years,
                    where members from across the world participated in a wide variety of high-quality training courses
                    and
                    opportunities for networking and fellowship, namely:
                </p>

                    Active participation in a local becomes the primary vehicle by which a member can explore the
                    opportunities offered by JCI.

                <p class="{res.style.noBottomMargin}">
                    JCI is proud to offer opportunities in the following four areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Individual development</b>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The range of programs and projects that provide these opportunities to members varies depending on
                    the local organization, which itself is based on the preferences and desires of its members. Every
                    year,
                    JCI Canada awards prizes for the programs, specific projects and achievements of individuals, and
                    all
                    this emphasis on the variety of activities undertaken by the different sections of the JCI Canada.
                    Our
                    members are very active both in their local community by participating in activities that range from
                    the organization of training programs on trade and development staff, to participation in
                    international
                    conferences, to through participation in networking events and fundraising for various charities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We organize a number of national programs to encourage the development of leadership skills among
                    our
                    members and in their communities. Our flagship programs include the Outstanding Young Person Award
                    (TOYP) (which are among its former winners Margaret Atwood, the Honourable Jean Charest, and Wayne
                    Gretzky), the Best Business Plan Competition and Effective Speaking Competition. We hold regional
                    conferences across Canada, as well as a National Convention every year in September in which we
                    offer
                    meetings, training, competitions and activities that promote collegiality.

                    Since their affiliation with the Junior Chamber movement, many Canadians have contributed to the
                    advancement of youth. In keeping with this tradition, JCI Canada is now a growing presence from
                    coast to
                    coast with 30 local chapters and more on the way.

                <p>
                    Established in 1987, JCI Quebec City was founded to provide the opportunity for young entrepreneurs
                    and professionals to expand their networks and to learn how to develop leadership and social skills.
                    Considered as an important actor in the community, JCI Quebec City organizes more than 50 activities
                    each year and, as a result, has an impact on the social economic landscape of the region by
                    promoting personal and professional development of Quebec City youth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2000, members from the Quebec City local chapter voted to adhere to the JCI movement to enhance
                    our capability to serve the community and to twin with organizations of similar values and purpose
                    both across Canada and the world. Since becoming a member, JCI Quebec City has sent delegates to
                    attend several national conventions, area conferences and the 13 past world congresses. Numerous
                    members held National Offices, two of which served as JCI Canada National President in 2008 and
                    2012. Our own François Begin is currently serving as JCI International Vice president assigned to
                    Europe.

                    only two years. Quebec City established a benchmark for conventions in Canada by offering VIP

                    JCI’s Association Internationale des Jeunes Chambres Francophones (International Francophone Junior
