History is rich with examples of JCI Canada members who have been actively involved in the success of the International Junior Chamber. One of the most outstanding members was certainly Phil Pugsley of Montreal, Canada who became the seventh JCI President in 1951. Pugsley envisioned the idea of a Senatorship which could honour and recognize the achievements of exceptional members and could enable them to remain in contact with the Junior Chamber movement throughout their life. Through his perseverance, the JCI Senate was created in 1952 at the 7th JCI World Congress in Melbourne, Australia.
